# Manipulating data

`SELECT` is by far the first and most used SQL keyword by any SQL user, in particular analysts. However, it will not help you to store, change or delete data within your database. In order to do that, you'll need different commands.

The three essential commands are:

* `INSERT` for inserting data into a table
* `UPDATE` to change data inside a table
* `DELETE` to delete data from a table

## Preparation

Connect to the `AdventureWorksLT` database, and execute the following script. This will create some tables we can safely use without messing with the original database.
